# NiceRF SX1280 modules

A number of my projects use breadboard friendly plug in boards. They allow the function of the board to be readily changed without requiring a re-design or separate board.

Most of these boards are breadboard friendly so can be used on standard 0.1" spacing breadboards, stripboards or matrix boards. The standard layout of a board is 2 rows of 8 pins. My boards extend this to 2 rows of 10 pins. The extra 4 pins are often needed for LoRa devices.

The Arduino boards I was using for the SX1280 distance testing accept a BBF board so the function of the board can be easily changed for Hope RFM9x, Dorji DRF127x or as in the tests the NiceRF SX1280 LoRa module.  

The boards should be available from StuartsProjects store on Tindie;
